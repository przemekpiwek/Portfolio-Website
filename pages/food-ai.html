        <p>
          Food AI is a project I completed with one other teammate as part of a
          tech-innovation competition, Cooperathon. It aims to reduce
          environmental footprint by managing culinary inventory and providing
          tailored recipes for expiring food. Unlike other cooking apps, the
          product combines personalized recipe generation and pantry management
          so that you can save money, eat healthier, and live sustainably.

      <h1>THE CHALLENGE</h1>
      <p>
        If "food waste" were a country, it would be the third-largest emitter of
        greenhouse gases. In Canada alone, this represents a $29 billion of
        value lost along the supply chain and 193 million metric tonnes of
        carbon dioxide equivalent emitted. What is equally surprising, household
        behavior is responsible for 40% of the food wasted with two-thirds being
        avoidable. My high-level goal was to create a cooking application that
        provides a solution to this problem.
      </p>
      <h1>DESIGN PROCESS</h1>
      <p>
        In the design process, I followed a user-centered approach and applied
        Design-Thinking methodology.
      </p>
      <figure>

      <h1>Empathize</h1>
      <p>
        I began my process browsing existing applications and reading their
        reviews in the App Store and Google Play stores. This gave me insight
        into pain points, features people liked, and where to strategically
        position FoodAI. I discovered the market is dividing into two clusters:
        one that focuses on pantry management and expiry reminders (i.e. Beep
        Noise, Fridgly), and the other on recipe generation (i.e. Glouton,
        Mealime). Currently, no player offers a solution where these two markets
        intersect - and this presents an ideal opportunity for FoodAI.

      <h2>What the app reviews told me:​</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cooking is a personalized experience - people need options based on
          their specific needs (i.e. dietary preferences, filters, favorites,
          etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          People don't want lots of recipes. High ratings are a major decision
          driver.
        </li>
        <li>
          People hate disruptions to the cooking process (i.e. pop-up videos,
          ads, long introductions, instructions, etc.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        To find out more about my potential users, I launched an online survey
        with a focus on finding:​
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What is my key demographic?</li>
        <li>What are the tasks associated with cooking?</li>
        <li>Why do consumers waste food?</li>
        <li>What pain points are associated with the cooking experience?</li>
        <li>What features are people willing to pay for?</li>
        <li>Why do consumers choose to cook?</li>
        <li>What are the drivers for food selection?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Data gathered from 80 respondents suggested my prioritized customer
        segment is flexitarian (semi-vegetarian) Millenials; this group is
        actively seeking ways to reduce their carbon footprint and are willing
        to pay for features that accomplished that. With this information, I had
        an idea of my end-user and conducted several interviews and contextual
        inquiries with candidates who fit this profile.
      </p>

      <h2>The key insights from the survey and interviews include:</h2>

      <h2>DEFINE</h2>

        I gathered my findings using an Affinity Diagram, where I found
        interesting opportunities for the product.

        From my preliminary user profile, I created a persona to help model my
        end-user.

      <h2>IDEATE</h2>
      <p>
        After having a clear understanding of the problem/solution landscape and
        user needs, I generated ideas that help deliver my value proposition and
        differentiate my application.
      </p>
      <h4>KEY FEATURES</h4>
      <p>
        Grocery Receipt Scanner - Users can scan their grocery receipts. Using
        an Optical Character Recognition API, the food items are identified and
        categorized in their inventory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inventory Manager with Expiration - Users can keep track of their fridge
        and pantry contents in their inventory, where an expiration model
        predicts which foods are expiring first and notifies the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personalized Quiz before Meals - Users can choose to interact with a
        short quiz before deciding what to cook to gauge their immediate
        culinary preferences, mood, and needs. This reduces friction points for
        the user and opens the possibility of future revenue-generating streams,
        such as selling market intelligence to grocery stores.
      </p>
      <p>
        Smart Recipe Generator - The user is presented with healthy and
        delicious meals based on the recommendations of a machine learning
        algorithm, which prioritizes their culinary preferences, inventory
        content, and expiring foods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meal Metrics - Users are informed about their meals through a weekly
        report that gauges the carbon emissions associated with their meals and
        a sustainability score that will incentivize users to be more conscious
        about their eating habits. They have the option of offsetting their
        emissions, which can be achieved by planting trees (the average cost of
        carbon offsetting for a North American is approximately $3 per user,
        annually).
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure all user actions are accounted for, I created a User Flow and
        Site Map for the application.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/img/projects/foodAI/site-flow.png" alt="" />
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="/img/projects/foodAI/user-flow.png" alt="" />
      </figure>
      <h2>PROTOTYPE</h2>
      <p>
        Having a thorough understanding of the information architecture, I began
        prototyping the design of the application. I began with lo-fidelity
        sketches for rapid and cost-effective prototyping and moved towards
        medium-fidelity prototypes once I had a solidified idea of what worked
      </p>

      <h2>FINAL MOCK-UP:</h2>
      <!-- insert video -->
      <h4>KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS</h4>
      <p>
        To determine which features users perceived as most valuable and
        validated our UX process, I would focus on engagement, rather than
        transactional, metrics. Some of these include:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Average weekly scan rate</li>
        <li>Meals cooked from "Cook Now" tab</li>
        <li>Average quantity of expired food items</li>
        <li>Click through rate for weekly sustainability report</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Future Steps</h4>
      <p>
        I would like to validate the goal of the application, which is to reduce
        food waste. I would send out surveys prompting users to estimate their
        food waste reduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        With an approximate 60% reduction, FoodAI can make an immediate impact
        on my locality, Montreal, which has a growing waste problem. Using the
        information from the city's annual waste report, Project de Plan
        directeur de gastion des matières rèsiduelles, I calculated the
        application's impact per 1000 users and compared them to Montreal's
        goals (seen below):
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/img/projects/foodAI/savings.png" alt="" />
      </figure>
      <h2>ITERATE</h2>
      <p>
        Usability studies are currently under development to validate the
        hypotheses that drove the product design and remove friction points for
        the user experience.
      </p>
      <h2>THINGS I LEARNED:</h2>
      <p>
        After speaking with programmers with ML experience, I discovered the
        accuracy of the O.C.R API would hover around 80%, with a maximum value
        of around 90%. Subsequent usability studies revealed manual entry of
        food items would be considered a major pain point and could present
        feasibility issues. Moreover, building a model for each specific user
        would require lots of training data, which means the user realizes
        maximum value only after long-term continued use. In the future,
        collaboration with technical leads early on would have prevented these
        issues.
